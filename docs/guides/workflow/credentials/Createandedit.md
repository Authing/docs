 Create and edit credentials
 [#](#create-and-edit-credentials "Permanent link")
=================================================================================



 You can get to the credential modal by either:
 


* Opening the left menu, then selecting
 **Credentials** 
 >
 **New** 
 and browsing for the service you want to connect to.
* Selecting
 **Create New** 
 in the
 **Credential** 
 dropdown in a node.



 Once in the credential modal, enter the details required by your service. Refer to your service's page in the
 [credentials library](/integrations/builtin/credentials/) 
 for guidance.
 



 When you save a credential, n8n tests it to confirm it works.
