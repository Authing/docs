 [#](#credentials "Permanent link")
=================================================



 Credentials are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node.
 



 Access the credentials UI by opening the left menu and selecting
 **Credentials** 
 . n8n lists credentials you created on the
 **My credentials** 
 tab. The
 **All credentials** 
 tab shows all credentials you can use, included credentials shared with you by other users.
