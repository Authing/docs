<IntegrationDetailCard title="Introduction of Odoo">

Odoo is an open-source commercial application based on Web Service. The main function of Odoo includes CRM, Website Builder, E-commerce, repository management, project management, billing and accounting, sailpoint, human resource, marketing and manufacture, etc.

Authing provides common authentication and authorization platform on cloud which could support Web, iOS and Android. Our production could help developers and enterprises solve complicated IAM (identity access management) cases for customers in a brand new but simple way.

This introduction will show you how to integrate Odoo and Authing on cloud to achieve Single Sign On.

## Requirements

1. The organization needs an unified account system to manage both internal and external employees of the company. Additionally, the account in the system should be able to log in to the Odoo with SSO.
2. Besides Odoo, the system should also have capability of achieving SSO with other self-designed systems and third-party systems.

## Solutions

1. Setup " Use Authing Single Sign On " in OAuth 2.0 configuration of Odoo to achieve Single Sign On.
2. For self-designed systems, Authing could integrate these systems with SDK and send identities for different services as the identity console.

## What is OAuth 2.0?

OAuth 2.0 is the most popular authorization protocol which can be used to authorize third-party applications to get user profiles. This definition is kind of abstract, but you can get more information in this article written by Yifeng.Ruan http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2019/04/oauth_design.html
