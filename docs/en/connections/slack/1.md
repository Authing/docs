<IntegrationDetailCard :title="`Fill in the Slack API application configuration in ${$localeConfig.brandName}`">

You need to add the configuration of the app you created in the previous step to {{$localeConfig.brandName}}:
1. In the [{{$localeConfig.brandName}} Console](https://console.authing.cn), go to the `Social` configuration page and click `Create Connection` to start selecting and creating.

2. In all social identity source icons, find and go to **Slack** Login.
3. In the configuration form, follow the instructions to fill in the following configuration:

- `Client ID`: Slack App ID;
- `Client Secret`: Slack Client Secret;
- `Callback URL`: **This is your business callback domain name, which is not a concept related to the callback link configured by the self-built application, nor is it related to the callback address configuration of the third-party social login console**. For example, your website domain name is https://example.com , and the url for processing {{$localeConfig.brandName}} callback requests is /auth/callback , then you should fill in `https://example.com/auth/callback`. This parameter is deprecated. It is recommended to configure the callback link separately in the application, where the address can be filled with `#`.


4. After the configuration is complete, click the 'Create' button to complete the creation.
