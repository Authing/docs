<IntegrationDetailCard title="Create an app on the Slack API platform">

Please follow the [Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack#implementation) to create an application. You need to record the **App ID**, **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Signing Secret** of the application, which will be used later. You can refer to the following process.

First, create an app via [Slack API: Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) by clicking Create New App.

If you have never used Slack before, you may need to create a workspace first: click Create Another Workplace and complete the creation.

Once you have the Workspace, go back to [Slack API: Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click Create New App to continue app creation. If prompted to choose a creation method, choose From scratch. After entering the App Name and selecting Workspace, click Create App to complete the creation.

After completing the creation, you will see the basic information about the app (Basic Information). Scroll down to App Credentials, where the **App ID**, **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Signing Secret** are recorded, you may need them later.

Finally, click OAuth & Permissions in the sidebar, find the Redirect URLs setting area on the page, and click Add New Redirect URL to add the following callback address: `https://core.authing.cn/connection/social/{Unique Identifier}/{YOUR_USERPOOL_ID}/callback`. After adding, click Save URLs to save the settings.

During creating an application, you need to configure the allowed callback address, using the following settings:

```
https://core.authing.cn/connection/social/{Unique Identifier}/{YOUR_USERPOOL_ID}/callback
```

> Replace `{Unique Identifier}` with the unique ID of the identity provider you are creating by Authing, and replace `{YOUR_USERPOOL_ID}` with your [UserPool ID](/en/guides/faqs/get-userpool-id-and-secret.md)
