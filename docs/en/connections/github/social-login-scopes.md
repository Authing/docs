# OAuth Scopes supported by Github

<LastUpdated/>

When initiating a Github login, you can request the user to grant the required Gtihub permissions by specifying the scope parameter. If the user agrees to the permissions contained in the scope, Github Access Token will have the appropriate permissions. If the user denies certain permissions, Github Access Token cannot be used to access the API corresponding to Github.

When you specify scope when configuring a connection, Github displays the selected permissions on the Github confirmation page for confirmation.

If your application does not have a browser environment for end users to confirm authorization, you do not need to select any scope, see more [Authorizing OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow).

You can carry Token to send a Head request to the relevant Github API to see what scope it needs:

```shell
$ curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com/users/codertocat -I
HTTP/2 200
X-OAuth-Scopes: repo, user
X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes: user
```

- X-OAuth-Scopes：the scope of the current token。
- X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes：the scope required by this API。
