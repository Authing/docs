<IntegrationDetailCard :title="`Fill in the GitHub OAuth application configuration at ${$localeConfig.brandName}`">

You need to add the configuration of the application you created in the previous step in {{$localeConfig.brandName}}:



1. In the [{{$localeConfig.brandName}} Console](https://console.authing.cn), go to the 'Social' configuration page and click 'Create Connection' to start selecting and creating.

2. In all social identity provider icons, locate and enter the **GitHub** social login.
3. In the configuration form, follow the instructions to fill in the following configuration:

- `Client ID`: GitHub Client ID；
- `Client Secret`: GitHub Client Secret；
- `Callback URL`：**This is your business callback domain name, and the callback link to the self-built application configuration is not a concept, nor is it related to the callback address configuration of the third-party social login console**。For example, the domain name of your website is https://example.com, and the url for processing {{$localeConfig.brandName}} callback requests is /auth/callback, so you should fill in as https://example.com/auth/callback. This parameter is no longer recommended for Use and it is recommended that the callback link be configured separately in the application, where the address can be filled in #.
- `Scopes` (optional): By default, {{$localeConfig.brandName}} only requests authorization from users for basic user information (such as avatars, nicknames, mailboxes, etc.), and if you need more advanced permissions, you can check the corresponding options. For more information, see [Configuring Login Authorization Scopes](./social-login-scopes.md).

4. When the configuration is complete, click the Create button to complete the creation.
