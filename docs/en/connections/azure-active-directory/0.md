<IntegrationDetailCard title="Register an Application in Azure Active Directory">

To enable users to login to your applications with Azure AD accounts, you need to register your application at Microsoft Azure Portal firstly.

> Here is the official document with more details: [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)

You need focus on following settings during the registeration process:

- `Supported account types`: Which is the supported types of your accounts and you need to choose appropriate type for your use cases. If you wish accounts from other organizations also could use your applications, please choose `Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant`, or you just want users in your own organization to use these applications, please use `Single tenant`.
