<IntegrationDetailCard :title="`Setup the Configuration of the Azure AD Application in ${$localeConfig.brandName}`">

Firstly, make sure you have registered an application in Azure AD and get its `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

1. Go to [Authing console ](https://console.authing.cn/console/userpool) - **Connect IdP** / **Enterprise IdP**, and find **Connect Microsoft Azure AD**.

- `Connection Identifier`: The identifier for this connection and can not change after configuration.
- `Display Name`: The Authing login sheet will use a button that shows "Use {Display Name} Login" if this field is set.
- `Application Logo`: The Authing login sheet will put this logo on the button that shows "Use {Display Name} Login" if this field is set. The size of the logo is 20\*20.
- `Client ID`: The Client ID when registering the application in Azure AD.
- `Client Secret`: The Client Secret when registering the application in Azure AD.

3. Setup advanced configuration (optional).

- `Synchronize user profile during every login`: Which is enabled by default. When this function is enabled, Authing will automatically synchronize users' profile when they login with Azure AD.
- `Email validation policy`: Which is disabled by default. Because Azure AD cannot make sure every user's email is validated, so you need to set this configuration according to your user cases.
