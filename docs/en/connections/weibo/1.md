You need to add the configuration of the app you created in the previous step in {{$localeConfig.brandName}} :

1. In the [{{$localeConfig.brandName}} console](https://console.authing.cn), go to the "Social Identity Source" configuration page, click "Create Social Identity Source" to start selecting and creating.

2. Among all social identity source icons, find and enter **Weibo** Social Login.
3. In the configuration form, follow the instructions to fill in the following configuration:

- Client ID: Weibo application ID;
- Client Secret: Weibo application key;
- Redirect: **This is your business callback domain name, which is different from the callback link configured in the Weibo web application**. For example, your website domain name is https://example.com, and the url to process the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} callback request is /auth/weibo/callback, then you should fill in `https://example.com/auth /weibo/callback`. If you need to configure the callback link separately in the OIDC or OAuth application, the address here can be filled with `#`;
- Scopes (optional): By default, {{$localeConfig.brandName}} will only apply to the user for authorization of basic user information (such as avatar, nickname, etc.), if you need more advanced permissions, you can check the corresponding Options. For details, see [Configuring Login Authorization Scopes](social-login-scopes.md#sina-blog).

4. After the configuration is complete, click the "Create" button to complete the creation.
