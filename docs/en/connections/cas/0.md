<IntegrationDetailCard title="Configure your own CAS identity provider">

First, you need to configure your CAS identity provider (IdP) and get information about it. This paper takes the CAS IdP that is brought with {{$localeConfig.brandName}} as an example.

First open the **{{$localeConfig.brandName}} Console** and enter the pool of users you want as an identity source, which is called **'User Pool A'**. Click the Apply option on the left menu to find an application in the right panel that you want to enable CAS IdP capabilities to go to the application configuration page.

> If there is no appropriate application, you can create a new application with reference to Step 3.

Find the CAS Identity Providers panel in the App Configuration tab, turn on the Enable CAS IdP switch, and click the Save button in the upper right corner. Record the contents of "Login Endpoint" and "Service Ticket Verification Endpoint (CAS 2.0)", which will be used later in the configuration.
