Next, connect the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} CAS IdP you just created in another user pool.

Open the **{{$localeConfig.brandName}} console** and enter the user pool that you want to connect to the CAS identity source, which is called **'User Pool B'**. From the left menu, select 'Authentication' > 'Enterprise' and find 'Create Connection' at the top right.

> The user pool connecting the CAS identity source and the user pool as the CAS identity source cannot be the same.

Configure the following options in an open form:
- `Unique Identifier`: Unique marker for this connection that cannot be modified after setting.
- `Display Name`: The name of the identity source displayed on the login interface button.
- `Logo`: The identity source logo displayed on the login interface button.
- `CAS Authorization URL`: The URL used to initiate an authentication request to the CAS IdP. Fill in the Login Endpoint that was previously recorded.
- `CAS Ticket Validation URL`: URL used to obtain identity information from CAS IdP. Fill in the previously recorded "service ticket verification endpoint (CAS 2.0)."

Next, go back to **User Pool A**, which was initially configured, and find the application that previously enabled CAS IdP to the application configuration page. Locate the URL Settings panel under the Apply Configuration tab and fill the https : //core.authing.cn/api/v2/connection/cas/{Connection ID}/callback into the Log In Callback URL box, where the `{Connection ID}` section changes to the 'Connection ID' just recorded.

Finally, click the Save button to save the configuration.

As a result, the configuration process is complete and a sample application can be created and the connection tested.
