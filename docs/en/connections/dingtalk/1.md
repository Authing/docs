3. In the configuration form, follow the instructions to fill in the following configuration:

- Redirect: **This is your business callback domain name, which is different from the callback link configured in the QQ web application**. For example, your website domain name is https://example.com, and the url to process the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} callback request is /auth/qq/callback, then you should fill in `https://example.com/auth /qq/callback`.
