During the application creation process, you need to configure the allowed callback addresses, please use the following settings:

```
https://core.authing.cn/connection/social/{ Unique Identifier }/{YOUR_USERPOOL_ID}/callback
```

> Replace { Unique Identifier } with the unique identifier filled in by the identity source you are creating by Authing, and replace {YOUR_USERPOOL_ID} with your [User Pool ID](/en/guides/faqs/get-userpool-id-and-secret.md)
