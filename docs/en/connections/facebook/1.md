2. Among all social identity source icons, find and go to **Facebook** Social Login.
3. In the configuration form, follow the instructions to fill in the following configuration:

- `Client ID`: Facebook application ID;
- `Client Secret`: Facebook application secret;
- `Callback URL`: **This is your business callback domain name. It is not a concept with the callback link configured by the self-built application, nor is it related to the callback address configuration of the third-party social login console**. For example, your website domain name is https://example.com, and the url for processing the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} callback request is /auth/callback, then you should fill in `https://example.com/auth/callback `. This parameter has been deprecated. It is recommended to configure the callback link separately in the application, where the address can be filled with `#`.
- `Scopes` (optional): By default, {{$localeConfig.brandName}} will only apply to the user for authorization of basic user information (such as avatar, nickname, email, etc.), if you need more advanced permissions, you can Check the corresponding option.


4. After the configuration is complete, click the "Create" button to complete the creation.
