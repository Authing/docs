Please follow the [Twitter documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/getting-started) guidelines to create in the [Twitter Developer Center](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/) For an application, you need to record the **API Key** and **API Secret Key** of the application, which will be used later.

In the process of creating an application, you need to fill in the callback address allowed by the application, please use the following settings:

```
https://core.authing.cn/connection/social/{Unique Identifier}/{YOUR_USERPOOL_ID}/callback
```

> Replace `{Unique Identifier}` with the Unique Identifier of the identity provider you are creating by Authing, and `{YOUR_USERPOOL_ID}` with your [UserPool ID](/en/guides/faqs/get-userpool-id-and-secret.md)
