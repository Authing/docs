2. Among all social identity feed icons, find and go to the **Twitter** social login.
3. In the configuration form, follow the instructions to fill in the following configuration:

- `API Key`: Twitter application ID;
- `API Secret Key`: Twitter application key;
- `Callback URL`: **This is your business callback domain name. It is not a concept with the callback link configured by the self-built application, nor is it related to the callback address configuration of the third-party social login console**. For example, your website domain name is https://example.com, and the url for processing the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} callback request is /auth/callback, then you should fill in `https://example.com/auth/callback `. This parameter has been deprecated. It is recommended to configure the callback link separately in the application, where the address can be filled with `#`.
- `Scopes` (optional): By default, {{$localeConfig.brandName}} will only apply to the user for authorization of basic user information (such as avatar, nickname, email, etc.), if you need more advanced permissions, you can Check the corresponding option.

4. After the configuration is complete, click the "Create" button to complete the creation.
