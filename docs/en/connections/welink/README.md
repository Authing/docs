After creating the WeLink identity source on the Authing console, you need to configure the callback address to the **OAuth client authorization settings** in the WeLink app on WeLink open platform.

## Step 3：Development access

- **Recommended development access method**: Use a hosted login page

- **Description of advantages and disadvantages**: The operation and maintenance are simple, and Authing is responsible for the operation and maintenance. Each user pool has an independent second-level domain name; if you need to embed it into your application, you need to use the pop-up mode to log in, that is: after clicking the login button, a window will pop up, the content is the login page hosted by Authing, or the browser redirects to the login page hosted by Authing.

- **Detailed access method**:

3.1 Create an app in the Authing console. For details, see: [How to create an app in Authing](/guides/app-new/create-app/create-app.md)

3.2 On the created WeLink identity source connection details page, open and associate an app created in the Authing console
