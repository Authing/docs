2. In all social identity source icons, find and go to **QQ** Login.
3. In the configuration form, follow the instructions to fill in the following configuration:

- Client ID: QQ Client ID；
- Client Secret: QQ Client Secret；
- Redirect：**This is your business callback domain name, unlike the callback link configured in the QQ web application.** For example, the domain name of your website is https://example.com, and the url for processing Authording callback requests is /auth/qq/callback, so you should fill in as `https://example.com/auth/qq/callback`. If you need to configure callback links individually in an OIDC or OAuth application, fill in `#` here.
- Scopes (optional): By default, {{$localeConfig.brandName}} only requests authorization from users for basic user information (such as avatars, nicknames, etc.), and if you need more advanced permissions, check the corresponding option. For more information.

4. When the configuration is complete, click the Create button to complete the creation.
