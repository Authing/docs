<IntegrationDetailCard title="Select server configuration mode">

You can open the server configuration on the **Development** -> **Basic Configuration** page in the background of the WeChat public platform. When the user scans the QR code of the official account and follows the official account, Authing can receive the user scan code and Follow the event to complete the login.

Since only one WeChat server configuration can be set, you need to choose two different modes according to your specific scenario:

- **Mode 1**: Set the server address as the endpoint of the Authing server. This mode is the easiest, but all the events of the WeChat official account will be pushed to the Authing server, and you will lose other events except scanning codes and following.

- **Mode 2**: Set the server address as your own server, and then forward the scan code and attention events to the Authing server endpoint. This mode requires a certain amount of development work, but will not lose events, and it is beneficial to use the official account in the future. Events do more extensions.

<IntegrationDetailCard title="Mode 2: Set the server address to your own server, and then forward the scan code and attention events to the Authing server endpoint">

The configuration process and mode are exactly the same, just set the URL to your own server address. You need to complete interface verification and message forwarding operations on the server endpoint configured by yourself.
