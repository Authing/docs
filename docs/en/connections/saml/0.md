<IntegrationDetailCard title="Create SAML IdP">

Make sure your SAML IdP support Service Provider-initiated flow. And prepare below information from SAML IdP.

> Have a try on GitHub Open Source [SAML Identity Provider](https://github.com/mcguinness/saml-idp).

- IdP Issuer URI — Usually are SAML Identity Provider `entityID` in `EntityDescriptor`
- IdP Single Sign-On URL — SAML Identity Provider endpoint for Authing request。
- IdP Signature Certificate — SAML Identity Provider public key to verify PEM or DER in SAML Message.

In certain scenarios, `Issuer URI`, `Single Sign-On URL`, `Signature Certificate` may only available after upload metadata (ACS URL, Audience URI). However ACS URL and Audience URI only available after created in Authing. Please proceed to step 2 if you are facing this issue.
