2. Among all social identity source icons, find and go to **Google** Social Login.
3. In the configuration form, follow the instructions to fill in the following configuration:

- `Client ID`: Google OAuth application ID;
- `Client Secret`: Google OAuth application secret;
- `Callback URL`: **This is your business callback domain name. It is not a concept with the callback link configured by the self-built application, nor is it related to the callback address configuration of the third-party social login console**. For example, your website domain name is https://example.com, and the url for processing the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} callback request is /auth/callback, then you should fill in `https://example.com/auth/callback `. This parameter is no longer recommended Use , it is recommended to configure the callback link separately in the application, where the address can be filled with `#`.

4. After the configuration is complete, click the "Create" button to complete the creation.
