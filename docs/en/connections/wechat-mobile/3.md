<IntegrationDetailCard title="Start developing access">


In this part, please follow the [WeChat Official Documentation](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/oplatform/Mobile_App/Access_Guide/iOS.html) guide to access WechatOpenSDK. If you encounter problems, here is a Swift Demo App For developers' reference: [https://github.com/authing/AuthingIOSDemo](https://github.com/authing/AuthingIOSDemo) .

### Initiate login request

After successfully accessing the SDK, you should be able to successfully open WeChat to obtain user authorization and obtain the authorization code:

The following is a code example for initiating a WeChat login request (Swift):

```swift
func loginByWechat() {
    let req = SendAuthReq()
    req.scope = "snsapi_userinfo" //Get user information
    req.state = "123" //A random value is enough, here is a timestamp
    WXApi.send(req)
}
```

You can get the authorization code code in the onResp method of AppDelegate or SceneDelegate, as shown in the following figure:

### Receive WeChat callback data acquisition code

Here is a sample code (Swift language):

```swift
func onResp(_ resp: BaseResp) {

    debugPrint(resp)

    // WeChat login request information
    if resp.isKind(of: SendAuthResp.self) {
        if resp.errCode == 0 && resp.type == 0{
            let response = resp as! SendAuthResp

            // WeChat authorication_code
            let code = response.code
            debugPrint("code: " ,code)
        }
    }
}
```

### In exchange for user information

After the user agrees to receive the `code`, you can call the `loginByWeChatCode` method of [Swift SDK](/en/reference/sdk-for-swift.md) to get the user information:

```swift
func loginByWeChatCode() {
    //Login through the authentication code returned by the WeChat SDK
    let code = "code"
    // Normal
    self.client?.loginByWeChatCode(code: code, completion: { status in
        print(status)
    })
}
```
