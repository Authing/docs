You can configure the Yidun identity source on the Authing console, and you can quickly complete the password-free login function through Authing on the mobile phone.

## Precautions:

1. Go to [NetEase Yidun](https://dun.163.com/dashboard?v=0116&locale=zh-CN#/login/?referrer=%2F) to register an Alipay open account;
2. Go to [Edun Service Management Background](https://dun.163.com/dashboard#/m/verification/index) and follow the instructions to create a **website application**.
3. If you do not have an Authing console account, please go to the [Authing Console](https://authing.cn/) to register a developer account;

## Step 1: Create the app

Log in to the Yidun service management background to create a business; then log in to the application management background to create an application; finally, perform business binding. For specific and detailed operations of Easy Shield, please refer to the [Easy Shield Number Authentication Console User Guide](https://support.dun.163.com/documents/287305921855672320?docId=424413790996844544).

After creating the application, setting the package name, uploading the signature and other operations, you need to record the business ID (business Id) and the product key SecretId and SecretKey of the number authentication service access credential. This data is required for subsequent configuration of the Yidun identity source in the Authing console.
