# Difference

Create a new list of items in a list that do not appear in another list.

The output is a new list, which is a subset of the original list (list1) and contains only those items that are not in list2. The list can be of any type, but all three lists must be of the same type. Notice that case is ignored here.

## Enter parameters

- `list1` : list of targets filtered using the Difference function card.
- `list2` : List of items to be removed from list1. You can add additional lists to filter from Listing 1.

## Output parameters

- `list` : indicates the filtered list.
