# Get First Item

Given a list, two outputs are returned: the first item and the list of deleted items (also known as Shift).

## Enter parameters

- `list` : Start the list. Be sure to set the type of the list (for example, list of objects or list of numbers)

## Output parameters

- `list` : Returns a list that does not contain the first item. (Be sure to set the type of the output list to match the type of the input list.)
- `item` : Returns the first item. (Be sure to set the type - for example, if the input list is a list of numbers, then item should also be set to a number.)
