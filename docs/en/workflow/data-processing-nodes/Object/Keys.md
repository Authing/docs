# Keys

The <strong>Keys</strong><strong> </strong> card is used to generate a list of all keys in the object.

## Enter the field

- `object` : The object from which you want to extract the key.

## Output field

- `output` : The key of an object organized as a text list.

## Example

If the input object is ` {" Name ":" Emily ", "Age" : "66", "Hair Color" : "Brown", "Eye Color" : "175"} `

Then the output list is: '["Name", "Age", "Hair Color", "Eye Color"]'
