# Values

The <strong>Values</strong> card generates a list of the values in the object:

## Enter the field

- `object` : The object from which you want to extract the value

## Output field

- `output` : Object values organized in a list. You can select a list type based on the values in the object.

## Example

If the input object is ` {" Name ":" Emily ", "Age" : "66", "Hair Color" : "Brown", "ID" : "175"} `, the output will be list ` [" Emily ", "66", "Brown", "175"] `.
