# Node Introduction

The "XML" node is mainly used to convert JSON format data sources to XML format, or to convert XML format data sources to JSON format.

The nodes mainly include the following configurations:

- Data source, the raw data to be converted, can be inputted by oneself or assembled through data assembly to assemble the data source before the current node.
- The conversion method can be selected, including "XML to JSON" and "JSON to XML".
- Attribute name, the attribute name of the converted data result, defaults to data.
- Options provide multiple option configurations for different conversion methods.
