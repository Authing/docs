> You can go to this [website](https://sample-sso.authing.cn/oauth/auth?client_id=5d70d0e991fdd597019df70d&scope=user&redirect_uri=https://sample.authing.cn&state=456346&response_type=code) to experience。

Approw will authenticate whether the user is legal. After the authentication is passed, the browser will be redirected to the **redirect_uri specified when the authorization login request is initiated** and passed the authorization code parameter through the URL query.
