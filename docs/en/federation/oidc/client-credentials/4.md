<IntegrationDetailCard title="Obtain An AccessToken That Has Permissions">

The **OIDC Authorization Framework** provides many authorization modes. n this scenario, obtaining user growth information belongs to **M2M** (machine-to-machine) authorization, without the participation of the user, the caller uses his own identity to access the API interface of the resource server, the **OIDC ClientCredentials mode** is required here.

Through the OIDC ClientCredentials authorization mode, the caller needs to provide Authing with his ClientCredentials (that is, the Key and Secret of the **programming access account**) and the required permission scope (that is, the **resource identifier**) to directly obtain AccessToken with the API permissions.

![](~@imagesZhCn/guides/authorization/m2m-flow.png)

1. The caller sends the Key and Secret of the **programming access account** and the **scope** required to be requested to Authing.
2. Authing verifies the Key and Secret of the **programming access account**, and verifies the scope permission items according to the permission rules configured by the administrator, and issues an AccessToken **has the access resource permission**, and the denied permission scope **will not** appear in AccessToken.
3. The caller carries the AccessToken to access the resource server.

For the caller to be able to access the protected API interface, it must first **obtain an AccessToken that has permissions**. To do this, the caller needs to send a POST request to the following address.

Request address：`https://{Application domain name}.authing.cn/oidc/token`

Sample Code：

```js
const axios = require("axios").default;
const options = {
  method: "POST",
  url: "https://{applicaion domain name}.authing.cn/oidc/token",
  headers: { "content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
  data: {
    grant_type: "client_credentials",
    client_id: "{Programming access account Key}",
    client_secret: "{Programming access account Secret}",
    scope: "{Permission items, separated by spaces}"
  }
};

axios
  .request(options)
  .then(function(response) {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

We only authorize the read permission of the announcement information to outsourcing company A. If outsourcing company A carries other scopes when requesting authorization, for example: `announce:read announce:update revenue:read customer user-growth:read`. Authing will deny all permissions except `announce:read`. The following is the result returned when outsourcing company A requests authorization. The denied permissions are in `rejected_scope`.

The AccessToken information contains the permission scope：

![](~@imagesZhCn/guides/authorization/client-credentials-token.png)

Let's look at the authorization of outsourcer B. If outsourcer B wants to request the following scope: `user-growth:2020:read` `user-growth:2019:*` `user-growth:2019:read` `revenue:create` `revenue:*:read` `customer:read`

The return result of Authing is as follows：

![](~@imagesZhCn/guides/authorization/client-credentials-result-2.png)

It should be noted that the administrator only authorizes all permissions for the user growth data in 2019 to the B outsourcing company, so when requesting the scope of the user growth data in 2020, it was rejected.

<IntegrationDetailCard title="Scope Permission Item Specification">

Authing's scope permission items are separated by **spaces**, and the format of each item is `resource identifier: resource operation`.

The following are all scope formats supported by Authing:

`book:1:read` It means the read permission of the book resource numbered 1

`book:*:read` It means the read permission of all book resources

`book:read` It means the read permission of all book resources

`book:*:*` It means the read permission of all book resources

`book:*` It means the read permission of all book resources

`book` It means the read permission of all book resources

`*:*:*` It means the read permission of all book resources

`*:*` It means the read permission of all book resources

`*` It means the read permission of all book resources

</IntegrationDetailCard>

<IntegrationDetailCard title="Add API Authentication Interceptor">

After Authing defines the API, you need to add an API authentication interceptor to your actual business API interface. For protected resources, only visitors who carry a legal AccessToken and have the required permissions are allowed to visit.
The code example is as follows：

```javascript
var express = require("express");
var app = express();
var jwt = require("express-jwt");
var jwks = require("jwks-rsa");
var port = process.env.PORT || 8080;
var jwtCheck = jwt({
  secret: jwks.expressJwtSecret({
    cache: true,
    rateLimit: true,
    jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
    jwksUri:
      "https://{applicaion domain name}.authing.cn/oidc/.well-known/jwks.json"
  }),
  audience: "{Programmatic access account ID}",
  issuer: "https://{applicaion domain name}.authing.cn/oidc",
  algorithms: ["RS256"]
});
// Verify the legitimacy of AccessToken
app.use(jwtCheck);

app.post("/article", function(req, res) {
  //Verify that AccessToken has the required permissions
  if (!req.user.scope.split(" ").incldues("write:article")) {
    return res.status(401).json({ code: 401, message: "Unauthorized" });
  }
  res.send("Secured Resource");
});

app.listen(port);
```
