<IntegrationDetailCard title="Create A Programmatic Access Account">

After defining the resources and operations, add a **programmatic access account** for the application, which is the **caller** of the application API interface. This account has a pair of **AK and SK**, which are used by the outsourcer to call the "big screen display" application interface. We can hand over AK and SK with different permissions to different outsourcers so that they have different permissions and can access different APIs.

Create two programming access accounts, fill in the AccessToken expiration time and remarks, and click OK.

If the program access account is deleted, the caller will lose the ability to obtain user authorization.

### AccessToken Expiration Time

When you create a programmatic access account, you need to specify the AccessToken expiration time. Authing uses the RS256 signature algorithm to sign when issuing the AccessToken to ensure that the AccessToken will not be tampered with.

> Token signature is a part of JWT. For more information, please refer to [JWT Interpretation and Usage](/advanced/authentication/jwt-token.md)。

RS256 is an asymmetric signature algorithm. Authing holds the private key to sign the Token, and consumers of JWT use the public key to verify the signature.
The RS256 signature algorithm has the following benefits:

1. Anyone can use the application public key to verify the signature, and the signer must be Authing.
2. There is no risk of private key leakage. If you use HS256 but leak the application key, you need to refresh the key and redeploy all APIs.

For more details on signature issues, please refer to [Verification Token](../../advanced/verify-jwt-token.md)。

We have just created two programming access accounts, which will need to be handed over to outsourcers in the future.
