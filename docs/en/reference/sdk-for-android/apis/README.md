# APIs

<LastUpdated/>

The Guard SDK provides a rich and comprehensive user authentication and user management API to help you authenticate and manage users.

To complete the authentication process such as login registration using API, you need to build your own login and registration UI independently.

> Note: Hypercomponents can also help you quickly build UI interfaces, and components are already integrated with apis.
