# Integrate Social Authentication with Authing

<LastUpdated/>

Social authentication is an authentication method that allows users to use the identity information of some common social platforms to login to a third-party application or authentic themselves in some other websites. For example, you can sign in YouTube with your gmail account. Social authentication can improve users' login experience on third-party platforms and provide an easy way for users to register new accounts in these platforms.
