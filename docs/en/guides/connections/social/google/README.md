| ----- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Unique ID | a. The unique ID consists of lowercase letters, numbers, and -, and the length is less than 32 bits. b. This is the unique identifier of this connection and cannot be modified after setting. |

## Step 3: Development Access

- **Recommended development access method**: use the hosted login page

- **Description of advantages and disadvantages**: Simple operation and maintenance, and {{$localeConfig.brandName}} is responsible for operation and maintenance. Each user pool has an independent second-level domain name; if you need to embed it into your application, you need to use the pop-up mode to log in, that is: after clicking the login button, a window will pop up with the content of {{$localeConfig.brandName}} hosting login page, or redirect the browser to the login page hosted by {{$localeConfig.brandName}}.

- **Detailed access method**:

3.1 Create an app in the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} console. For details, see: [How to create an app in {{$localeConfig.brandName}}](/guides/app-new/create-app/create-app.md)

3.2 On the created Google identity source connection details page, open and associate an application created in the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} console
