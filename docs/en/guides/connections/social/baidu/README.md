## Scene introduction

- **Overview**: Baidu social login is a secure login for users to third-party applications or websites using Baidu as their identity source. By configuring and enabling Baidu's social login in {{$localeConfig.brandName}}, you can quickly obtain Baidu's basic open information and help users achieve password-free login through {{$localeConfig.brandName}}.
- **Application scenario**: Baidu OAuth application
- **End User Preview**:

## Precautions:


- If you have not registered a Baidu developer account, please go to [Baidu Developer Center](https://developer.baidu.com/) to register a developer account.
- If you do not have a {{$localeConfig.brandName}} console account, please go to the [{{$localeConfig.brandName}} console](https://authing.cn/) to register a developer account.

## Step 1: Create a website application on Baidu Open Platform

- Register [Baidu Developer Center](https://developer.baidu.com/), log in and go to [Baidu Developer Service Management Console](http://developer.baidu.com/console#app/project), Fill in the developer information and create a project (application):

On the security settings page, set the authorization callback page address to: https://core.authing.cn/connection/social/baidu/<YOUR_USERPOOL_ID>/callback

> Replace <YOUR_USERPOOL_ID> in it with your user pool ID.

## Step 3: Development Access

- **Recommended development access method**: use the hosted login page

- **Description of advantages and disadvantages**: Simple operation and maintenance, and {{$localeConfig.brandName}} is responsible for operation and maintenance. Each user pool has an independent second-level domain name; if you need to embed it into your application, you need to use the pop-up mode to log in, that is: after clicking the login button, a window will pop up with the content of {{$localeConfig.brandName}} hosting login page, or redirect the browser to the login page hosted by {{$localeConfig.brandName}}.

- **Detailed access method**:

3.1 Create an app in the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} console. For details, see: [How to create an app in {{$localeConfig.brandName}}](/guides/app-new/create-app/create-app.md)

3.2 On the created Baidu identity source connection details page, open and associate an application created in the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} console
