| Callback URL      | This is your business callback domain name, which is not the same concept as the callback link configured in the self-built application, nor is it related to the callback address configured in the third-party social login console. For example, if your website domain name is https://example.com and the url for handling {{$localeConfig.brandName}} callback requests is /auth/callback, then you should fill in https://example.com. That parameter has been It is not recommended to use this parameter, and it is recommended to configure the callback link separately in the application, where the address can be filled in #. | The |
| Callback Address  | Twitter's redirect URI. You need to configure this URL to the callback address of the application created on the Twitter platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Login Mode |

Once the configuration is complete, click the "Create" or "Save" button to finish the creation.

In the Twitter created project, select the app you just created, scroll down to the bottom and under the **User authentication settings** section, click the **Set Up** button to enter the authentication settings page

Select App permissions as needed, by default **Read** is sufficient for authentication, **Callback URI / Redirect URL** fills in the callback address displayed after the Twitter identity feed is created on the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} console.

**Website URL** Just fill in your site's homepage and click Save

## Step 3: Development Access

- **Recommended development access**: Use a hosted login page

- **Description of advantages and disadvantages**: Simple to run and maintain, run by {{$localeConfig.brandName}}. Each user pool has a separate secondary domain; if you need to embed it in your application, you need to use the popup mode login, i.e.: after clicking the login button, a window will pop up with {{$localeConfig.brandName}} hosted login page, or redirect the browser to {{$localeConfig.brandName }} to the hosted login page.

- **Detailed access method**.

  3.1 Create an app in the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} console, for details see: [How to create an app in {{$localeConfig.brandName}}](./guides/app/create-app.md)

  3.2 On the created Twitter identity connection details page, open and associate an app created in the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} console
