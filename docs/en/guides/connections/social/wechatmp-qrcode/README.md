# Wechat Official Accounts QR Code

<LastUpdated />

## Introduction

- **Overview**: "Following the official account login" refers to the process of generating a QR code of the WeChat official account on the PC website. The user scans the code with the WeChat APP and follows the official account to realize the process of automatic login. Using "Follow Official Account Login" can quickly attract traffic to the official account and enhance brand stickiness. With {{$localeConfig.brandName}}'s "Follow Official Account Login", you hardly need to develop any code, just simple configuration and it can be completed in a few minutes.
- **Application scenarios**: PC website
- **End-User Preview**:

## Precautions

- Restricted by the requirements of the WeChat platform, only the service account has the ability to [Generating QR Code with Parameters](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/offiaccount/en/Account_Management/Generating_a_Parametric_QR_Code.html) API. Please make sure that your official account is a service account type.
- If you do not have an {{$localeConfig.brandName}} Console account, please go to the [{{$localeConfig.brandName}} Console](https://authing.cn/) to register a developer account.

## Step 1: Enable server configuration

### Get public account development information

You can get the `AppID` and `AppSecret` on the **Settings and Development -> Basic Configuration** page in the background of the WeChat public platform, which will be used in step 2 later.

### Set up IP whitelist

You need to add the IP of the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} server to the IP whitelist of the WeChat official account. You can [click here](https://core.authing.cn/api/v2/system/public-ips) to get the list of external IPs of the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} server.

### Add API permissions

You need to add the [Generate QR Code with Parameters](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/offiaccount/en/Account_Management/Generating_a_Parametric_QR_Code.html) interface permission on the Settings and Development - Interface Permissions page of the WeChat Official Account Platform:

### Select server configuration mode

You can open the server configuration on the **Settings and Development -> Basic Configuration** page in the background of the WeChat public platform. When the user scans the QR code of the official account and follows the official account, {{$localeConfig.brandName}} can receive the user's scan code and follow events to complete the login.

Since only one WeChat server configuration can be set, you need to choose two different modes according to your specific scenario:

- **Mode 1**: Set the server address as the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} server endpoint. This mode is the easiest, but all the events of the WeChat official account will be pushed to the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} server, and you will lose other events except code scanning and following.
- **Mode 2**: Set the server address to your own server, and then forward the scan code and attention events to the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} server endpoint. This mode requires some development work, but will not lose events, and is conducive to more expansion based on official account events in the future.

#### Mode 1

- **URL**: set to `https://core.authing.cn/connections/social/{Identifier}/{USERPOOL_ID}/events`, replace `{Identifier}` with the unique identifier you entered in the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} Console configuration area, and put it in Replace `{USERPOOL_ID}` with your [UserPool ID](/en/guides/faqs/get-userpool-id-and-secret).
  > If there is no `Identifier`, you can create the identity provider and modify it later.
- **Token**: You can set the Token in the WeChat official account to any string, it must be in English or numbers, the length is 3-32 characters, and make sure that the token you configure in the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} Console and the required access The tokens provided by the official account are the same.
- **EncodingAESKey**: The message encryption key consists of 43 characters, which can be modified randomly. The character range is A-Z, a-z, 0-9.
- **Message Encryption Method**: Please select it according to your business needs, it is recommended to use Security Mode.

Click Submit to save, and finally don't forget to enable this server configuration:

#### Mode 2

The configuration process and mode 1 are exactly the same, just set the `URL` to your own server address. You need to complete interface verification and message forwarding operations on the server endpoint configured by yourself.
