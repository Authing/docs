# Basic Deployment

<LastUpdated/>

## Overview

Orchestration-based containerized deployment operation and maintenance has gradually become the current mainstream method. Whether it is an infrastructure environment based on Kubernetes or Docker, business components can be built quickly through orchestration, and efficient operation and maintenance management can also be achieved. Here we It is recommended that you use a container-based deployment scheme.

- [Docker deployment](./docker-compose.md)
- [Kubernetes deployment](./kubernetes.md)

Of course, we also provide a traditional physical machine-based deployment solution. The advantage of physical machine deployment is that it can make full use of the resources of the physical machine and can finely control the deployment process.
This article will introduce the basic deployment plan of Authing IDaaS platform and specific operation guidance.
