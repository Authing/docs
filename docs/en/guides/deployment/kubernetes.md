# Kubernetes Deployment

<LastUpdated/>

## Overview

Authing will not change the user's existing cloud infrastructure, Authing will be as much as compatible with the user's cloud environment. Therefore, Authing proposed the concepts of "Cloud Neutrality" and "Authing Inside". Authing can maintain it's neutral characteristics in a multi-cloud environment, and it can be deployed in AWS, Tencent Cloud, Alibaba Cloud or private cloud environments.In a hybrid cloud or private cloud environment, Authing will be integrated into the customer's IT system like Intel.
This article will introduce the Kubernetes-based deployment plan and specific operation guidance of the Authing IDaaS platform.

## Overall structure

The high-availability architecture of the Authing IDaaS platform is running in VPC (virtual private cloud), through LB (load balancing), multi-availability server clusters in the same region are virtualized into a high-performance and highly available service pool as a whole. Based on load balancing Rules, the request from the client is distributed to the availability zone in the service pool.

Each availability zone is composed of a set of Kubernetes Nodes, and each availability zone is equipped with a complete set of Authing IDaaS platform. IDaaS cluster is a stateless service, while the database cluster is a stateful master-slave synchronization architecture. If a server appears in a certain availability zone fails or the server is unavailable, LB will transfer the traffic to another available zone, which will also assign the role of master cluster.
Load balancing will detect the health status of each availability zone in real time, and automatically isolate the availability zones with abnormal states, thereby improving the overall service capabilities of the application.
