# Docker Deployment

<LastUpdated/>

## Overview

Docker Compose is a set of orchestration tools based on the Docker engine. You can use Docker Compose to quickly deploy the Authing IDaaS platform with one click
Authing under the Docker deployment scheme is a stand-alone deployment. If you want to deploy a highly available version of Authing, please refer to:[Kubernetes Deployment](./kubernetes.md).
This article will introduce the Docker Compose-based deployment plan of the Authing IDaaS platform and specific operation instructions.

## Overall structure

<img src="./images/docker.png" style="margin-top: 20px;" class="md-img-padding" />
The main components of the Authing IDaaS platform architecture include: object storage service, Redis, ElasticSearch, Postgres and Authing Server.Authing Server, as the main service of the Authing IDaaS platform, receives requests from clients; object storage is used as a service for storing static resources; Redis stores session information, data caching, etc.; Postgres is used to store core business data; ElasticSearch is used for data statistical analysis and logs collection and analyze the work.
Authing IDaaS platform uses the ELK architecture for logging system. The Authing Server writes logs into the Log File. Logstash writes the log information into the ElasticSearch service by reading the Log File. This ensures that multiple IDaaS clusters follow a unified pipeline: Collection -> Transmission -> Storage -> Analysis process, and Kibana is used as a graphical UI management interface for operation and maintenance management, which greatly reduces the complexity and error rate of operation and maintenance work, and improves the work efficiency of operation and maintenance staff.
