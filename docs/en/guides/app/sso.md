# Implement Single Sign-on Between Mutiple Applications

<LastUpdated/>

After enabling single sign-on between applications, the login status between different applications under the same user pool will be connected

At first you can create two applications follow the [guidelines](./create-app.md).

## Configure SSO

Go to the menu **Applications** > **SSO**, click **Add Application** in the upper left corner, then select **Self-built App**, find the application you just created in the list below, click **+**, the configuration of multi-application SSO is completed.
