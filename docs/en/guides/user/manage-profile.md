# Manage User Accounts

<LastUpdated/>

Managing user accounts includes completed procedures such as forgetting passwords, verifying email addresses, modifying the bound phone number and email address, multi-factor authentication, disabling user accounts, binding social login, and account merging. If you use Authing, congratulations, these are all built-in functions in Authing, and you only need to spend a very short time to finish them.

## Use Online Login Page and Personal Center

Authing provides developers with a built-in, comprehensive, beautiful, and highly configurable login form. You can feel it by [clicking here](https://sample-sso.authing.cn/) (we will call this login form as `Guard` in the following paragraphs), the address is `https://< YOUR_DOMAIN>.authing.cn/`:

There will be a user personal center, you can feel it by clicking [here](https://sample-sso.authing.cn/u), the address is `https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>.authing.cn/u`:

## Use SDK/API

Authing provides Authentication SDK/API and Management SDK/API. You can use Authentication API and complete user self-service personal account information management and use Management SDK/API to manage user information as an administrator. Operations performed by an administrator are no need to perform verification methods such as phone number verification code, email verification code, and MFA.
