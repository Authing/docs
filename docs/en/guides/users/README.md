# User Directory Management

<LastUpdated/>

You can understand the Authing user directory as a directory that stores all your user information. You can search for users and check user information in the user directory. You can also manage the user directory configuration, such as registration disabled, configuring whitelists, etc. The Schema of this user directory is extensible, you can add user-defined fields, at the same time, you can use a variety of standard protocols (such as SAML, LDAP, OIDC, OAuth2.0) as an Identity Provider to provide external identity certification ability.
