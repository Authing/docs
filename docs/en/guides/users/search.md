# Search for Users

<LastUpdated/>

Authing supports using fields such as mailbox, user name, mobile phone number, nickname, etc to do the fuzzy search to users in both [console](#Use 控制台搜索) and [SDK](#Use -sdk-搜索) modes:

## Search for Users Using Console

You can search for users by keywords on the **user management** -> **user list**:
