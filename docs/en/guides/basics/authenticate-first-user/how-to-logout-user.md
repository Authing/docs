## Log out from the front end

Guide your end users to visit `https://{application_domain_name}.authing.cn/login/profile/logout?redirect_uri={{CALLBACK_URL}}` to logout. `redirect_uri` can be filled in with a callback address after logging out. For example, you can redirect the user to your business homepage.

> Attention ⚠️: you need to use encodeURIComponent to do URI encode operation on the callback link.
