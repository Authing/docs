## Migration Flow

Authing supports migrating user information from customized database to Authing database without stopping the server. When this function is enabled, the normal login and registration requests will be affected:

Authentication request:

- The Authing will use your customized database script to authenticate user when he/she tries to login for the first time. The user information will be migrated to Authing database if the authentication succeeds or it will throw an error to notify the user that the account does not exist or the password is wrong.
- Users do not need to change their password
- When users try to login again, the authentication flow will use the Authing database.
- When all users are at least authenticated successfully for one time, the migration flow succeeds.

Registration flow:

- When a user tries to register a new account, the script will check if the account already exists in the Authing database. If a same account is found, the script will throw an error to notify the user the account already exists.
- If the user is not in the Authing database, the `getUser` interface in the script will check if the user is in the customized database. If the same account is found, the script will throw an error to notify the user the account already exists.
- If the user is not found in both databases, the registration flow succeeds.

## Setup Scripts

You need to access [Authing console](https://console.authing.cn/console/userpool) and go to **Connect IdP** - **Customized database** to setup scripts of **login** and **searchUser**. You can find more details at:

- [Compile login script](./configuration/#编写数据库操作脚本)。
- [Compile searchUser script](./configuration/#编写数据库操作脚本)。

## Test Migration Result

After you enabled the user migration function, you can test migrated users in following ways:

- Use [admin API for getting user list or seraching users](/en/reference/sdk-for-node/management/UsersManagementClient.md#获取用户列表).
- Check users in **User Management** - **User List** of the [Authing console](https://console.authing.cn/console/userpool).

## After Migration

You need to disable the customized database after all migration work is done
