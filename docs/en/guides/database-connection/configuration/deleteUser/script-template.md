This script will be called when admin uses console or API to delete user account. This script is only required in CUSTOM_USER_STORE mode.

### Function Definition

Here is the definition of the `deleteUser` function:

```javascript
async function deleteUser(id, context) {
  // This script should validate password of a exists user entry in your database. It will
  // be executed when a user attempts to change password.

  // The first argument `id` is the user'id in your database

  // The last argument `context` contains information about the authentication context.
  // see http://core.authing.cn/connections/custom-db/config-custom-db-connection.html for more information.

  //
  // There are three ways this script can finish:
  // 1. Delete user success
  //    return true
  // 2. Delete user failed
  //    throw new Error("Delete Account Failed")
  // 3. Something went wrong while trying to reach your database:
  //    throw new Error("my error message")

  const msg =
    "Please implement the Delete Account script for this database connection";
  throw new Error(msg);
}
```

### The Rule of the Script's Return Value

#### User's Profile is Deleted Successfully

When the user's profile is deleted successfully, you need to return `true` in script.

```javascript
async function deleteUser(id, updates, context) {
  // Implement your logic here
  return true;
}
```

#### The User Does Not Exist

When the user does not exist, you need to throw an error. You can design different error messages. For example:

```javascript
async function deleteUser(id, updates, context) {
  // Implement your logic here
  throw new Error("User not exists!");
}
```

#### Other Abnormal Errors

When the user meets other errors, you can catch the error and return a friendly notice such as

```javascript
async function deleteUser(id, updates, context) {
  try {
    // Implement your logic here
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong ...");
  }
}
```

### Best Practice

#### Provide Friendly Error Annoncements

When an unknown error occurs, we recommend throwing a standard `Error` object, Authing will catch this error and return it to the end user. For example, using `throw new Error("My nice error message")` and you will find this error log in the **History Log** of the customized database.

#### Disable the Database Connection When Exit the Function

Remeber to close the database connection after the whole script is run. You can use client.end() in the try/finally to make sure this command will be executed.

```javascript
try {
  const result = await client.updates("YOUR updates");
} finally {
  // NOTE: always call `client.end()` here to close the connection to the database
  client.end();
}
```

### Example Functions

Assume we are using `postgres` as our database:

- You can use `env.DB_CONNECTION_URI` to get database connection string to create database connection.
- Excute `SQL` command `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = $1`, if `result.effected`is 0 which means the user does not exist, then throw an error with error message `User not exists!`.
- If the deletion succeeds, then the script will return `true`.
- Call `try/finally` in `client.end()` to disable database connection.

```javascript
async function deleteUser(id, context) {
  // This example uses the "pg" library
  // more info here: https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres
  const { Client } = require("pg");

  const client = new Client({
    connectionString: env.DB_CONNECTION_URI
  });

  // Or you can:
  // const client = new Client({
  //   host: env.DB_HOST,
  //   port: env.DB_PORT,
  //   user: env.DB_USERNAME,
  //   password: env.DB_PASSWORD,
  //   database: env.DB_DATABASE,
  // });

  await client.connect();

  const QUERY = "DELETE FROM users WHERE id = $1";
  try {
    const result = await client.query(QUERY, [id]);
    if (result.effected === 0) {
      throw new Error("User not exists!");
    }
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Execute query failed: ${error.message}`);
  } finally {
    // NOTE: always call `client.end()` here to close the connection to the database
    client.end();
  }
}
```
